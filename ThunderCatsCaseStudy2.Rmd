```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(sqldf)
```

## Load the data
```{r}
attrition_data = read_csv('atttrition.csv')

```
## EDA Phase 1: Plotting
  
```{r}
#let's partiton by attrition and look at the data a bit
left_data = sqldf("SELECT * FROM attrition_data WHERE Attrition = 'Yes'")
stayed_data = sqldf("SELECT * FROM attrition_data WHERE Attrition = 'No'")

ggplot(data=left_data, aes(left_data$Age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 3) 
ggplot(data=stayed_data, aes(stayed_data$Age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 3) 

counts_by_department = sqldf('SELECT 
                                  Department
                                  ,Attrition
                                  ,COUNT(*) 
                             FROM attrition_data 
                             GROUP BY Department
                                     , Attrition')

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
